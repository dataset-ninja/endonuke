**ENDONUKE** (Dataset dedicated to train the models for nuclei detection in endometrium samples) is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is applicable or relevant across various domains.

The dataset consists of 1780 images with 210420 labeled objects belonging to 3 different classes including *stroma*, *epithelium*, and *other nuclei*.

Each image in the ENDONUKE dataset has bounding boxes annotations. There are 40 (2% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *ds0* (1780 images). The dataset was released in 2021.
